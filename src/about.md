Hi! I'm Simo Virtanen, a designer and co-founder at [Sakeus](https://sakeus.fi), where I'm building new web application for all sorts of businesses. As a designer I've always strived to build a more human-centric web and think that designers should have more stake in actually building what they design. Over the years I've been coaching teams to improve their agile processes, designed and built multiple released applications for publicly traded companies and managed my own business.

I'm also an active member of the Finnish developer community as a co-founder of Helsinki Ruby ry, a non-profit organisation that aims to promote Ruby and software engineering in general in Helsinki and Finland and beyond. With Helsinki Ruby I've been organising developer events, including [Euruko](https://2022.euruko.org), [Oh The Humanity!](https://oh.helsinkiruby.fi), and Ruby meet-ups.
